# Installing and Compiling the HyperAST library

The HyperAST library is written in Rust, and we use the nightly channel.
You can find up to date instructions on how to install `rustup`, the Rust version manager https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/index.html.

Then you need to switch to the nightly channel, instruction are available in the following link https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/channels.html.

Finally you should be able compile with ``cargo build`` or ``cargo build --release`` if you want to produce executables with better performances.
